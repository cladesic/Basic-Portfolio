       <div class="paragraph" p>  My name is Charles Ladesic, I’ve been in support for over 27 years that include telecommunications to
            Information Technology. Early in my career I spent 9 years installing, programming, and project
            management in the telecommunication industry. The remaining 18 years was various positions at
            Verizon which included monitoring alarms in the Network Operation Center “NOC” to support and
            development in Application Support. During this time I obtained my Associate and Bachelor degree in
            Informational Technology of Arts. Along the way I’ve gained several friends and professional mentors
            that have assisted me in my career goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently continuing with my education to refresh and learn new programming languages/methods
            that will further my career in becoming a full time developer. I enjoy working or solving issues that occur
            in applications and find ways to improve or correct the issue in both reactive and proactive. My current
            job role is working on Zero-Touch automation, which is to take the human aspect out of repeating
            processes that can be automated.
